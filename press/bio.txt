Dead Soil is a Doom Industrial band from the Netherlands, blending dark, atmospheric soundscapes with heavy industrial elements. The trio consists of Danny on guitars and programming, Marc on bass, and Gaya on vocals. Formed just before the COVID-19 pandemic, with their music shaped by the intense emotions and isolation of that time, they released their first EP “231” just as the world was starting to open up again. Their music delivers a raw, immersive experience, drawing listeners into a dystopian, mechanical world. Dead Soil is known for their immersive live performances and a unique sonic fusion that merges doom's slow, crushing heaviness with the harsh, synthetic textures of industrial music.
